# Data Visualization Library Using Python and Web Assembly

In this project, I am creating a custom data visualization library using Python and WebAssembly, with HTML templating provided by Jinja. The goal is to leverage the power of Python for data processing and visualization, and to compile it into WebAssembly for efficient, high-performance rendering in the browser.
